# Godot Slang Extension Demo

This is a demo project showcasing the Godot Slang extension, which integrates the Slang shader language into Godot.

## About

The Godot Slang extension allows you to write and compile Slang shaders directly in your Godot projects, providing advanced shader capabilities and cross-platform shader compilation.

## Installation

1. Copy this entire `demo` folder to your Godot project directory
2. The extension should be automatically detected by Godot
3. Open the project in Godot and explore the example scenes and scripts

## Contents

- `bin/` - Contains the compiled GDExtension binaries
- `scenes/` - Example scenes demonstrating Slang shader usage
- `Scripts/` - Example scripts showing how to work with Slang shaders
- `project.godot` - Godot project file
- `*.slang` - Example Slang shader files
